I'm a Second-year([MS24058](mailto:ms24058@iisermohali.ac.in)) BS-MS student at IISER Mohali. Before IISER I studied at [Saint Paul's Kota](https://saintpaulskota.co.in/) since LKG(2010). I had PCMB(Physics + Chemistry + Maths + Biology) in high school. I'm interested in biology, maths, physics, robotics and, computers. I really love computer science and applying it's knowledge in unexplored areas of biology. I also love combining knowledge from different fields to something useful. I'm currently finding whether theoretical neuroscience is for me or not. Other than research I like contributing to [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community.
